Verify that the installation was successful by typing
```
python3.8 --version
```
```
Output

Python 3.8.0
```

## Linux users

To install Python on Linux we will only need *apt*command, so make sure to run all the commands as root or as user with sudo access.

First, we update the packages list and install the prerequisites using these commands
```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

Second, add the [deadsnakes](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) Personal Package Archives (PPA) to your system’s sources list
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```
When prompted (see below) press `Enter` to continue
```
Output

Press [ENTER] to continue or Ctrl-c to cancel adding it.
```

Once the PPA is added, install Python 3.8 with
```
sudo apt install python3.8
```
**PS**: You can install later versions of python. All you need is change the version on the last command and make sure it's available on the [deadsnakes packages](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages).

Verify that the installation was successful by typing
```
python3.8 --version
```
```
Output

Python 3.8.0
```
## MAC OS users

We will use the official installer from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) which is the most common way for installing Python on MAC.

First, from the [Python downloads website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) download the latest version of Python installer on your Mac by clicking on the download link

Let’s verify that Python and IDLE installed correctly. To do that, double-click IDLE, which is the integrated development environment shipped with Python. If everything works correctly, IDLE shows the Python shell as follows
